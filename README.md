# I-was-laid-off

In the year 2023, a deluge of software engineers (SEs) are laid off by their gatekeepers (the employers) at unprecedented rates. Without a google calendar invite reminder, he/she/them/they, at (or around) 5am, usually on a Friday (+1 if [direct deposits hit that day] else -0), are given (aka emailed) walking papers (better described as - the legally protecting, thoroughly curated, & sorta empathetic missive) thanking that SE for their years of ingenious problem solving (x + y = layoff), but due to [insert unassailable excuse], they were no longer the zuckerburgian genius, page+brin like intelligent & ballmeresque special teammate (more simply EMPLOYED (& happily {wink} compensated) at [insert company name]! Most importantly, the leader, culture curator, & singular uno leading the charge from the front, wished that SE the best in their future FUCKING endeavors! 

The SEs fight back...
